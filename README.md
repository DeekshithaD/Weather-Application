Weather Application using Reactjs

When the website is launched, the home screen will display the weather condition at the users' current location by fetching users  current latitude-longitude location 
The home screen has a search bar that will help the user to search for a particular place. If the user searches for a valid place name, the weather condition of that place would be displayed on the screen, otherwise, the users' current location weather is displayed.
For fetching weather conditions OpenWeather API is used.
